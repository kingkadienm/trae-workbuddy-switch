# Buddy Switch

**A multi-account manager for WorkBuddy / TraeWork**: OAuth QR-code sign-in, one-click login-state switching, credit-expiry monitoring with automatic check-in, token usage statistics — and it can expose your model quota to other local tools through an OpenAI / Anthropic compatible endpoint.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: this project is an **unofficial, third-party tool released under a noncommercial license** (source-available). It is not affiliated with, authorized by, sponsored by or endorsed by WorkBuddy, CodeBuddy, Trae / TraeWork or their respective rights holders. It reads and writes authentication data of third-party clients on your machine, sends automated requests on the schedule you configure, and can forward your model quota to other tools through a local endpoint. Before using it, read the [Disclaimer](docs/DISCLAIMER.en.md) in full, assess the risks yourself and make sure your usage complies with the applicable terms of service.

One interface, three forms:

| Form | How to get it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Desktop app** | Download the installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kingkadienm/trae-workbuddy-switch/releases/latest) | Packaged with Tauri; recommended for daily use |
| **webui (browser)** | Build from source, see [webui form](#webui-form-build-from-source) | The same frontend bundle as the desktop app, served over a local HTTP channel |
| **Online demo** | [GitHub Pages](https://kingkadienm.github.io/trae-workbuddy-switch/) | Read-only demo; accounts, credits and request records are fictional data and all business actions are disabled |

> **No npm distribution yet**: the npm package `@kingkadienm/buddy-switch` has not been published, so `npm i -g …` will not install it yet.
> For the webui form, follow [Build from source](#webui-form-build-from-source) below; the install command will be added here once it is published.

## Two product sections

Switch product sections at the top of the sidebar. The two sections are **fully independent**: separate account stores, separate clients and separate configuration, with no effect on each other.

| Section | Clients managed | Regions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **WorkBuddy** | WorkBuddy desktop client, CodeBuddy CLI, CodeBuddy CN IDE | CN (WorkBuddy) / Global (WorkBuddy AI) |
| **TraeWork** | Trae Work (clients `TRAE SOLO CN` / `TRAE SOLO`), Trae IDE (`Trae CN` / `Trae`) | CN / Global |

The pages under both sections are **structurally identical, item for item**: Accounts, Token Stats, Credit Stats, API Service, Settings.

> **Regions and client variants on the Trae side**: Trae has two product lines that can coexist on one machine (Trae Work and Trae IDE; the clients self-identify as `TraeWork CN` / `TraeCode CN`). They are switched **inside** the Trae section and do not occupy the sidebar. The variant is carried by the `?line=` URL parameter, so refreshing, sharing links and going back/forward all keep your current position.

## Quick start

### Desktop app

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kingkadienm/trae-workbuddy-switch/releases/latest):

| Platform | Installer | Installation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon (M-series, arm64) | `BuddySwitch_<version>_aarch64.dmg` | Open the DMG and drag `BuddySwitch.app` into Applications |
| macOS Intel (x86_64) | `BuddySwitch_<version>_x86_64.dmg` | Open the DMG and drag `BuddySwitch.app` into Applications |
| Windows x64 | `BuddySwitch_<version>_x64-setup.exe` | Run the installer and follow the prompts |
| Linux x64 | `BuddySwitch_<version>_amd64.deb` / `BuddySwitch_<version>_amd64.AppImage` | Install the `.deb` on Debian/Ubuntu; on other distributions mark the AppImage executable and run it directly |

On macOS, if the first launch reports that the developer cannot be verified, Control-click the app in Finder and choose **Open**, or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**. Only when the installer came from the official Releases above and the system still reports it as damaged, run:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/BuddySwitch.app"
```

If the app starts but reports a permission error when switching accounts, see [macOS permissions](#macos-permissions) below.

### webui form (build from source)

This project is not distributed through npm yet, so the webui form has to be compiled locally. **Mind the order**: the frontend bundle is embedded into the server binary at **compile time** (`rust-embed`), so you must build the frontend first and the server second:

```bash
npm install
npm run build                                    # 1) build the frontend → dist/
cargo build --release -p buddy-switch-server     # 2) build the server (embeds dist/)
./target/release/buddy-switch                    # 3) start the local service + open the browser (buddy-switch.exe on Windows)
```

Subcommands available after building:

```bash
buddy-switch              # start the local service and open the browser
buddy-switch serve        # start the service only, without opening a browser (--port to set the port)
buddy-switch status       # print the current account in the terminal
buddy-switch version      # print the version
```

The webui listens on `127.0.0.1:57890` by default. The interface is identical to the desktop app — the same frontend bundle, with the desktop app going through the Tauri command channel and the webui through a local HTTP channel.

> If you change the frontend without rebuilding the server, the UI will not change (the embedded bundle is stale). Stop any running `buddy-switch` before rebuilding, otherwise linking fails on Windows because the binary is locked.

## Features

### WorkBuddy section

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | OAuth QR-code sign-in, import from this machine, import from a backup file, add a token manually, delete accounts, export account backups |
| Account switching | Back up the auth file → close WorkBuddy → write the target account → restart, with live progress feedback throughout the switch |
| Session cloning | Copy the sessions selected on the current account to the target account under new ids (jsonl content + `workbuddy.db` index + edge-sync registration) |
| Automatic check-in | Enabled by default; checks on startup and catches up on a schedule; supports check-in all and a check-in log |
| Automatic travel | Automatically dispatches and claims the "Cat Travel" task |
| Token keep-alive | Lazy refresh (refresh only when the remaining lifetime is below a threshold before an operation) plus a daily keep-alive (one unconditional refresh per day by default), preventing refresh-token expiry |
| Credit expiry lookup | Query every account's credit grants, remaining amounts and expiry times; grants expiring within 7 days are highlighted and sorted by urgency, with the most urgent marked "use first" |
| Credit statistics | Aggregate official WorkBuddy request usage with daily trends, model breakdown, per-account consumption and request details; when official data is unavailable it clearly falls back to observing local balance snapshots |
| Token statistics | Separate overviews for WorkBuddy, CodeBuddy CLI and CodeBuddy IDE; input, output and cache read/write shown in K/M/B, with composition ratios, an activity heatmap, project/model top 10 and session ranking |
| CodeBuddy CLI | Reuses the same account store as WorkBuddy but keeps a separate default account; on macOS/Linux through `apiKeyHelper`, on Windows through `env.CODEBUDDY_AUTH_TOKEN` in `settings.json` for subsequent sessions |
| CodeBuddy CN IDE | Reuses the same account store; injects Safe Storage credentials into the `CodeBuddy CN` desktop client and restarts the IDE |
| Automatic rotation | A background job periodically sets the CodeBuddy CLI's account for subsequent launches to the account with the most urgent credit expiry; the current session keeps its original account |
| Scheduled tasks | Six task types — check-in, Cat Travel, Activity Map, token keep-alive, Back-to-School and Night Owl — each with its own toggle and configurable execution hour |
| Migrate data on switch | Merge the current account's long-term memory and connector configuration into the target account (same-name entries merged recursively, deduplicated by content), with same-version and cross-version migration supported; the original content is backed up before being rewritten |
| Permission check | macOS authorization walkthrough (App Management / Full Disk Access drag-to-authorize plus automatic detection) |
| Auto-update | Check GitHub Releases for new versions; full-package updates are signature-verified (tauri-updater) |

### TraeWork section

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | OAuth web sign-in (browser callback), paste `Cloud-IDE-JWT` manually, import from this machine, import from a backup file, delete accounts, export account backups |
| Groups | Accounts can be grouped, and the list can be filtered by group |
| Check-in | One-click check-in with credit refresh; supports "skip accounts already checked in today" and automatic renewal; account cards show check-in status and cooldown |
| Credits | Per-account remaining credits, per-package breakdown and expiry times; 7-day totals / earned / consumed trends |
| Token statistics | Token and call-count statistics over 7-day / 30-day / 90-day / all-history windows |
| Login-state switching | Write the selected account into the Trae client's login state (`profiles/`), with an automatic backup before switching; takes effect after restarting the client |
| Login-state snapshots | Save / restore / delete client login-state snapshots for easy rollback |
| JWT refresh | Refresh an account's JWT manually and see the remaining validity period (highlighted when close to expiry) |
| Device identifier | View and reset the device identifier |
| Environment detection | Automatically detect the installed product lines, client versions, running state and userData directories |
| Runtime logs | Client data directories, gateway request logs and operation logs viewed in one place |

### API gateway (independent per section)

Expose the current account's model quota to other local AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenWebUI, …) through **compatible endpoints**. Keys and account pools are isolated per product section and per region.

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compatible protocols | OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`) and Anthropic-compatible (`/v1/messages`), both supporting SSE streaming |
| Listen configuration | Binds to `127.0.0.1` only by default; changing it to `0.0.0.0` requires an explicit second risk confirmation |
| Default ports | WorkBuddy gateway `57891`; Trae gateway `7864` (Trae also has a local MITM proxy port `8899`, which login-state capture depends on) |
| API keys | Multiple keys can be created, each belonging to a specific region; the list shows only the prefix and **never stores plaintext or echoes the hash**; keys can be revoked and deleted |
| Model catalog | Fetch and display the available model list, with manual refresh |
| Account policy | Configure the account-selection strategy and the account-pool balance refresh interval |
| Request log | Record the model, account, tokens and status of every request; can be cleared |

## Usage

### WorkBuddy

1. **Add an account**: Accounts page → "Add via OAuth QR" (device flow), "Import local account" or "Import backup"
   - Since client 5.6, the login-state tokens are stored encrypted. **"Import local account" automatically calls the local client to unwrap that encryption** (requires the WorkBuddy desktop app to be installed), so check-in / credits / token stats work right after importing. If the client is missing or has changed its encryption scheme, the account is **still imported** but can only be used for "Switch"; click "Refresh token" on the account to retry unwrapping
2. **Switch accounts**: account card → "Switch"; you can optionally copy the current account's sessions along and merge long-term memory and connector configuration into the target account (for cross-version migration you can choose the data source region)
3. **Automatic check-in / Cat Travel**: toggle them directly at the top of the Accounts page; the Settings page lets you tune parameters, run a check-in immediately and view logs
4. **Check credit expiry**: the Accounts page automatically queries each account's credit grants; click "Refresh credits" to update manually — grants approaching expiry are highlighted and sorted by urgency
5. **View credit statistics**: sidebar → "Credit Stats" — overview, 30-day trend, model breakdown, per-account consumption and request details; changing the account or date filter does not re-hit the official API, only "Refresh statistics" collects again
6. **View token statistics**: sidebar → "Token Stats"; choose WorkBuddy, CodeBuddy CLI or CodeBuddy IDE to see input, output, cache read/write and call counts
7. **Connect CodeBuddy CLI**: one-click connect / update authentication on the Accounts page. "Switch CodeBuddy" only updates the default account used by **sessions loaded afterwards**; the currently running session is not switched — reload the session from ACP, or restart CodeBuddy CLI for it to take effect
8. **Switch CodeBuddy CN IDE**: switch the CN desktop client (www.codebuddy.cn) with one click from an account card. Switching closes and restarts CodeBuddy CN; before the first use, open and sign in to it manually once so that the Keychain Safe Storage entry is created
9. **Automatic rotation**: Settings → CodeBuddy CLI auto-rotation (policy below)
10. **Updates**: the app automatically checks the public GitHub Releases and lets you upgrade directly from the bottom-left corner

### TraeWork

1. **Add an account**: Accounts page → "OAuth web sign-in" (the browser completes authorization and then calls back) or "Paste JWT"; you can also use "Import local account" / "Import backup"
2. **Choose region and product line**: switch CN / Global at the top of the page; on an account card, switch the client variant to operate (TraeWork / TraeCode)
3. **Check-in**: "Check in and refresh credits" on the Accounts page, or per account; enable "Skip already checked in" to avoid duplicate requests
4. **Switch login state**: account card → "Switch", which writes the selected client's login state and restarts the client; a snapshot is saved automatically before switching
5. **Snapshot rollback**: Settings → "Login-state snapshots" to save / restore / delete
6. **API service**: sidebar → "API Service"; create a key and follow the integration guide on the page to configure it in your tool

### Automatic rotation policy (WorkBuddy)

The goal of automatic rotation is to avoid wasting credits by letting them expire: a background job periodically checks every account's credit expiry and sets the CodeBuddy CLI's default account for subsequent sessions to the **most urgent** one (earliest expiry that still has credits remaining). Neither the `apiKeyHelper` on macOS/Linux nor the settings env on Windows replaces the token a running session already holds; the rotation takes effect after ACP reloads the session or the CLI restarts. To avoid the default account changing too often, every check decides in this order:

1. **Eligible accounts**: only accounts that queried successfully, are not expired and still have credits remaining can be selected as the target
2. **Urgency check**: if every account expires far in the future (the most urgent one has more than `min_urgency_hours` left, default 72 hours) → do not switch
3. **Already the target**: if the CLI's default account already is the most urgent one → do not switch
4. **Cooldown**: do not switch again within `cooldown_minutes` (default 120) of the last switch
5. **Activity guard**: if a CLI session wrote within the last `active_guard_minutes` (default 30), i.e. a conversation is in progress → do not switch
6. **Value filter**: if the target account's remaining credits are below `min_remaining_credits` it is not worth switching (default 0, disabled; every check logs each account's remaining credits so you can tune this)
7. **Debounce**: if the target expires earlier than the current account but by less than `min_gap_hours` (default 24) → do not switch

> **Scope**: automatic rotation only updates the default account used by subsequent restore/load operations; it does not hot-switch the current session. On macOS/Linux the next helper run reads the latest account; on Windows the latest token is written into settings. A running session keeps the account it obtained at startup or load time — reload the session from ACP, or restart CodeBuddy CLI.

Configuration keys: `check_interval_minutes` (check interval, default 5), `cooldown_minutes`, `min_urgency_hours`, `active_guard_minutes`, `min_remaining_credits`, `min_gap_hours`. Adjust them on the Settings page, or edit `~/.buddy-switch/auto_rotate_config.json` directly.

## Screenshots

### WorkBuddy accounts

Account cards show login state, check-in state, credit balance and near-expiry grants in one place; the region switcher at the top toggles between WorkBuddy CN and Global, whose account stores are isolated from each other.

## Data and privacy

- All data is stored locally under `~/.buddy-switch/` and is never uploaded to any third-party service
- Account stores: WorkBuddy uses `accounts.json` (CN) / `accounts.global.json` (Global); Trae uses `trae/checkin_accounts.json` (CN) / `trae/checkin_accounts.global.json` (Global)
- Auth files: WorkBuddy uses `workbuddy-desktop.info` / `workbuddy-desktop-ai.info`
- The original auth file is backed up before switching accounts; Trae saves a snapshot before switching login state
- Gateway API keys are stored as prefix and hash only; the plaintext is returned once at creation time
- Local data is never committed to the repository; a token-pattern scan (`ghp_` / `npm_` / `gho_` etc.) runs before release

## macOS permissions

Switching accounts writes to WorkBuddy's auth file, which macOS gates behind **App Management** (or **Full Disk Access**) authorization:

1. If the first switch reports "no permission", click "Open System Settings"
2. Prefer enabling the BuddySwitch switch under **App Management**; if it is not listed there, go to **Full Disk Access** and drag BuddySwitch into the list
3. Restart this app for the authorization to take effect; "Permission check" on the Settings page lets you verify it at any time

> webui mode: permissions are those of the terminal process that started the service; if that terminal already has Full Disk Access, no extra steps are needed.

## Development

Environment requirements, build commands, release process and directory layout are documented in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). In brief:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # desktop development mode
npm run build         # build the frontend (dist/)
npm run check:api     # verify the frontend API contract matches the backend
```
